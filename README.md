## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to analyze heart disease data to uncover trends and factors that contribute to heart health. The analysis includes examining demographic information, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other clinical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) and includes the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- Oldpeak (depression induced by exercise)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels (0-3)
- Thalassemia
- Target Variable (Heart Disease Presence)

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-analysis.git
   cd heart-disease-analysis
   ```

2. Load the dataset and perform data analysis and visualization using Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.

3. The analysis and visualizations are saved in the `interactive_plots` folder. You can view them directly in your browser.

## Visualizations
This project includes several visualizations:
- Box plots to identify outliers in various health metrics.
- Bar plots showing the distribution of heart disease by age and gender.
- Histograms displaying cholesterol levels and blood pressure distributions.
- Interactive plots for a more detailed examination of the data.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into heart disease trends and risk factors. The findings can be beneficial for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals interested in understanding heart health better.
